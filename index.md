### Fraud Detection

Fraud is a significant challenge for many organizations, including financial institutions, e-commerce platforms, and healthcare providers. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems have limitations in identifying new and sophisticated fraud schemes. With the advent of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, fraud detection has become more efficient and accurate. ML algorithms can analyze large volumes of data, identify patterns, and detect anomalies in real-time. 

In this project, we will explore various ML models and algorithms to develop a fraud detection system that can identify fraudulent activities and transactions in a timely and accurate manner. Our goal is to build a system that can minimize false positives while maximizing the detection of actual fraud cases.
